              Hi, I'm S. B. Lennox, and I've always been a little obsessed with love stories. The kind that make you feel everything, the ones that stay with you long after they end. I grew up watching dramatic romance series and reading anything that could make my heart race or ache, and somewhere along the way, I realized I didn't just want to read those stories, I wanted to write them.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              I wrote my first book back in 2018. It never saw the light of day, but it taught me how much I love creating worlds where love isn't simple or safe, it's powerful, consuming, and real. For a long time, being an author felt impossible, like a dream just out of reach. But I learned that the only real limits are the ones we set ourselves. With passion, support, and a bit of stubbornness, you can make anything happen.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Now, I write dark romance, stories about strong women and possessive, all-in men who would burn the world for them. I've always believed that while a good man might be good for the world, a villain would destroy it for you, and there's something dangerously beautiful about that.
            </p>

              When I'm stuck on a scene, I grab my headphones, blast music, and go for a jog. There's something about being outside with my music turned up that gets my thoughts moving. I always end up pulling out my phone mid-run to jot down ideas before they're gone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reading and writing have always been my escape, a way to live a hundred different lives and feel every emotion along the way. I hope my stories make you lose yourself the same way they do for me—completely, recklessly, and with your whole heart.
